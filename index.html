<br>Using this site I will discuss the themes of Sucker Punch Productions' game: <i> Sly Cooper 2: Band Of thieves</i> and how the music composed by 
  Peter McConnell illustrates a push and pull between what is right and wrong.</br>

    <section> 
  <h2> The Story</h2>
    <br> Sly Cooper 2: Band Of Thieves is the 2nd installment in the Sly Cooper game series developed by Sucker Punch Productions in 2004 for the Playstation 2. 
    <p> The story of the game focuses on Sly Cooper and his gangs' mission to destroy robotic parts belonging to the murderer of Sly's Father: Clockwerk. To do this the Cooper Gang must plan heists throughout 
    Several regions of the world including: France, India, Canada, and Czechia. Following Sly Cooper 1, Sly's friends and colleagues are actually part of the heists and play a much bigger role in the overall narrative. 
    This among many other reasons, contributes to why this game has a much more mature tone than the previous installment. This is reflected in all corners of gameplay, but especially the music. </p>

    <p> As previously mentioned Peter McConnell composed the music for Sly Cooper 2 and would eventually do the same for 3 and 4. However, McConnell had no part in the music for the 1st game in the series. The 1st
    game's soundtrack was composed by Ashif Hakik and while both composers are undoubtedly talented and bring their own style to their work, I can't help but prefer McConnell. The soundtrack of Sly 1 definitely
    has more variety than it's sequel, but 2's consistency and minimalism fit the stealth gameplay much better than the often brash, explosiveness of Hakik's compositions. To illustrate this I've included a 
    piece from each composer to demonstrate my point. </p>

      <h2> A Stealthy Approach</h2>
      <br> The First Audio Example I've included is from Sly Cooper 1. Notice how this piece makes use of a hiphop style beat as well as industrial noises to evoke a mechanical vibe.

  <h2> Episode Menu 1</h2>
  <br> The Second Audio Example I've included is from Sly Cooper 2. In this piece it is clearly trying to emulate a "film noir" aesthetic. The brass accompanied by the accordian evokes the vibe of 1930s/40s
  detective movies and in turn this fits the game much more than the soundtrack of the 1st.

  <p> Listening to the 2 tracks back to back it should be clear to see they are both staunchly different. This is to be expected considering both are composed by completely different people, but on top of that
  Sly Cooper 1 and 2 are vastly different games. Sly Cooper 1 was a much more linear experience designed in the vein of earlier platformers like: Crash Bandicoot or Spyro. Sly Cooper 2 on the other-hand, had a
  much larger budget and as a result Sucker Punch Studios' ideas could be better realized. Because of this Sly 2 is what you may call; "Open World". This means each country visited in Sly 2 has it's own "Hub World" 
  which are in turn separated "episodically". This makes the story and the gameplay almost become one as each mission completed in the "Hub World" contributes to the ultimate goal at the end of each episode; the 
  heist. To illustrate this point I have attached video of a Sly 1 and Sly 2 mission to show the differences stretch beyond the music into gameplay as well. </p>

      <p> As you can see much like each soundtrack, both games are similar while also being distinct from one another. Sly Cooper 1 as previously mentioned is more linear than the 2nd installment and thus I feel 
      that is reflected in both the soundtrack and gameplay. Because of this a lot of smaller details are left out in Sly 1 and it makes the experience less memorable. In the <i> Reality Effect</i> Barthes describes
      the importance of small, innocuous details and how they matter to enhance an experience. Because of Sly 2's open nature, these details are far more prevalent and as a result the game becomes that much more immersive. </p>
