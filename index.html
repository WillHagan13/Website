<br>Using this site I will discuss the themes of Sucker Punch Productions' game: <i> Sly Cooper 2: Band Of thieves</i> and how the music composed by 
  Peter McConnell illustrates a push and pull between what is right and wrong.</br>

  <h2> The Story</h2>
    <br> Sly Cooper 2: Band Of Thieves is the 2nd installment in the Sly Cooper game series developed by Sucker Punch Productions in 2004 for the Playstation 2. 
    <p> The story of the game focuses on Sly Cooper and his gangs' mission to destroy robotic parts belonging to the murderer of Sly's Father: Clockwerk. To do this the Cooper Gang must plan heists throughout 
    Several regions of the world including: France, India, Canada, and Czechia. Following Sly Cooper 1, Sly's friends and colleagues are actually part of the heists and play a much bigger role in the overall narrative. 
    This among many other reasons, contributes to why this game has a much more mature tone than the previous installment. This is reflected in all corners of gameplay, but especially the music. </p>

    <p> As previously mentioned Peter McConnell composed the music for Sly Cooper 2 and would eventually do the same for 3 and 4. However, McConnell had no part in the music for the 1st game in the series. The 1st
    game's soundtrack was composed by Ashif Hakik and while both composers are undoubtedly talented and bring their own style to their work, I can't help but prefer McConnell. The soundtrack of Sly 1 definitely
    has more variety than it's sequel, but 2's consistency and minimalism fit the stealth gameplay much better than the often brash, explosiveness of Hakik's compositions. To illustrate this I've included a 
    piece from each composer to demonstrate my point. </p>
