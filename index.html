  <h1>A study of <i>Sly Cooper 2: Band Of Thieves</i> by Sucker Punch Productions: The musical minimalism of sneaking as a thief</h1>
  <img src="SlyCooper2.jpg">
<br>Using this site I will discuss the themes of Sucker Punch Productions' game: <i> Sly Cooper 2: Band Of thieves</i> and how the music composed by 
  Peter McConell illustrates a push and pull between what is right and wrong.</br>

  <h2> The Story</h2>
    <br> Sly Cooper 2: Band Of Thieves is the 2nd installment in the Sly Cooper game series developed by Sucker Punch Productions in 2004 for the Playstation 2. 
    <p> The story of the game focuses on Sly Cooper and his gangs' mission to destroy robotic parts belonging to the murderer of Sly's Father: Clockwerk. To do this the Cooper Gang must plan heists throughout 
    Several regions of the world including: France, India, Canada, and Czechia. Following Sly Cooper 1, Sly's friends and colleagues are actually part of the heists and play a much bigger role in the overall narrative. 
    This among many other reasons, contributes to why this game has a much more mature tone than the previous installment. This is reflected in all corners of gameplay, but especially the music. </p>
